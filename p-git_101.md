Here is a simple report of the steps we took to fulfill the project requirements:

1. Created a new project on the device using Command Line and named it "new-project."
2. Monitored the project using `git init`.
3. Created a file named "FileA" and a file named "FileB" inside the project.
4. Moved both files to the Staged stage using `git add`.
5. Added the staged files to the Repository using `git commit`.
6. Edited "FileA" and wrote a statement inside the file.
7. Undid modifications to "FileA" using `git restore`.
8. Edited "FileB" and wrote a statement inside the file.
9. Checked the project status using `git status`.
10. Moved "FileB" to Staged using `git add` and added it to the Repository using `git commit`.
